# Homeostat

This project attempts to extend Ashbyâ€™s homeostat machine using population-based optimisation methods. The homeostat is an ultra-stable system that is disturbed, and every optimisations made here are an attempt to recreate stability. Overall the experiment tries to scale the number of units in the systems and compares the effectiveness of a genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) in finding good solutions. There are two main hypotheses:

1) A genetic algorithm and a particle swarm optimisation algorithm are hypothesised to find solutions for higher numbers of units in the homeostat, compared to a random search method.

2) A PSO is hypothesised to find solutions quicker but should produce more suboptimal solutions than the genetic algorithm.
